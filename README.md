# Product Card Project Description
The Product Card Project is a simple yet elegant web component built using HTML and CSS. This project features a visually appealing product card designed to showcase a coffee mug.
# Key elements of the product card include:

* **Image of the Coffee Mug:** A high-quality image of a coffee mug is displayed prominently to catch the user's eye and provide a clear visual representation of the product.

* **Price Information:** The product card includes a section for the price, making it easy for potential customers to see how much the coffee mug costs.

* **Add to Cart Button:** A user-friendly "ADD TO CART" button is provided, allowing customers to quickly add the coffee mug to their shopping cart with a single click.

The project demonstrates fundamental HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling the components, resulting in a clean and modern product card interface suitable for any e-commerce website.
